  <h3>Aw...</h3>

  <p>It looks like your browser had trouble loading the small ad in my sidebar. I know ads can be awfully annoying
    these days, but I work with a <a href="http://carbonads.net/dev_code.php" target="_blank">niche advertising network</a> that only displays
    tasteful, hand-picked ads relevant to technology.</p>

  <p>Keeping this site up and running takes a massive amount of my time and a non-trivial amount of money for hosting
    and other expenses. <strong>It would mean a lot to me if you take a moment to whitelist my site in your
    ad blocking plugin</strong>. You'll help me be able to continue dedicating time and money to creating and hosting
    the kind of content you're here reading right now.</p>
